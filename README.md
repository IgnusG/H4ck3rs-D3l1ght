# H4ck3rs-D3l1ght

This project is part of a pro-seminar report I've done at my university. It is a very basic programming language inspired by *brainfuck* and mimicking *blub*, *ook* and similar.
The entire language consists of only 2 words (H4ck3rs and D3l1ght) and command operators. 

I think I'll write the rest of the documentation tomorrow ...
